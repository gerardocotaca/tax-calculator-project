# Tax Calculator

## Overview

The Tax Calculator is a Java-based console application designed to compute income tax based on user input. The program calculates federal and state taxes after deducting a standard amount based on the user's filing status. This project demonstrates basic Java programming skills, including user input handling, conditional logic, and arithmetic operations.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project was to create a functional income tax calculator that takes into account different filing statuses and tax brackets. The project aims to showcase the ability to implement tax calculation logic and manage user input in a Java application.

## Key Features

- **User Input Handling**: Collects gross income and filing status from the user via the console.
- **Filing Status Deduction**: Applies standard deductions based on the user's filing status.
- **Tax Calculation**: Computes federal and state taxes based on the user's net income.
- **Output Results**: Displays the gross income and final tax liability in a formatted output.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The project is implemented in Java, utilizing core language features such as variables, conditionals, and input handling.
- **Scanner Class**: Used for reading user input from the console.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Performs calculations to determine tax liabilities.

## Implementation Details

The program is structured to perform the following steps:

1. **Input Collection**: Prompts the user to enter their gross income and filing status.
2. **Deduction Calculation**: Determines the standard deduction based on the user's filing status.
3. **Net Income Calculation**: Computes the net income by subtracting the deduction from the gross income.
4. **Federal Tax Calculation**: Applies different tax rates based on the net income range.
5. **State Tax Calculation**: Calculates state tax as a fixed percentage of the net income.
6. **Final Tax Computation**: Sums the federal and state taxes to determine the total tax liability.
7. **Output**: Displays the gross income and final tax liability.

### Key Variables and Methods

- **`grossIncome`**: Stores the user's gross income.
- **`deduction`**: Represents the standard deduction based on filing status.
- **`netIncome`**: Calculated as the difference between gross income and deduction.
- **`federalTax`**: Computed based on net income using progressive tax rates.
- **`stateTax`**: Calculated as a percentage of net income.
- **`finalTax`**: Sum of federal and state taxes.

## Relevance to Software Engineering Roles

This project aligns with software engineering roles that require:

- **Java Programming**: Demonstrates proficiency in Java, including handling user input and performing calculations.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Showcases the ability to implement basic algorithms for tax calculation.
- **Console Applications**: Highlights experience in creating console-based applications with formatted output.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Program**: Use a Java compiler to compile the `TaxCalculator.java` file.
2. **Run the Application**: Execute the compiled Java program to start the tax calculator.
3. **Input Data**: Enter the gross income and filing status when prompted.
4. **View Results**: The program will display the gross income and final tax liability.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Tax Brackets**: Implement more detailed tax brackets and deductions based on current tax laws.
- **User Interface**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- **Error Handling**: Add robust error handling for invalid input and edge cases.
